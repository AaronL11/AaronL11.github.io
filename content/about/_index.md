# Who Am I?

Hello, I am Aaron. I have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the
[University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/).
I am 24 years old and made this website to show off my [projects](/projects/), but mostly just to
talk about things that interest me on my [blog](/blog/).
I wrote my [undergraduate Honour's thesis](/forms/Honour_s_Thesis.pdf),
on the operational semantics of generalized theories of probability, with a focus on possibilistic theories.
My thesis was supervised by Dr. Carlo Maria Scandolo and Msc. Sam Steakly at the University of Calgary.

## About Me

I began my university journey in physics, inspired by the numerous magical workings of the world around me.
I (naively) believed that one day I would understand and formulate every way the world worked in precise
mathematical equations. Those were simpler times, when clearly $F=ma$ ruled the world and before I understood
the importance of uncertainty.
As time went on I found myself annoyed at the constant labs and actual effort required to
do physics, and found that what I seemed to enjoy the most was building models and (more importantly) talking about
models. This lead me down a more theoretical path into the world of computation, logic, and mathematics.

I took a gap year after highschool and decided to make the most of it by teaching myself some math and also
a little python. It was here where I was first introduced to the [Rust cult](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
and my soul was damned. It was also when I discovered my passion for mathematics, which largely bled into
how I treated physics.
This passion for challenging myself led me to seek out competitions and I joined the university's
Competitive Programming Club where I eventually became president.

After a few years of messing around and unsuccesfully trying to get into computer science I came back to mathematics
where I finished my degree. I don't regret the strange and winding journey I took. I've made very many unique friends
along the way, many who I may not have known had I not started and traveled where I did.

## Why do you like mathematics?

My interest in mathematics actually came from esports. I wanted to learn higher level math concepts to be able to
rigorously prove (at the time calculate) how effective certain strategies where in the videogames that I played.
Unfortunately I quickly discovered that basic calculus was not enough for this task and so began a long journey
to touch various parts of mathematics.

## What are my main interests?

Currently my main interests in mathematics lie in Category Theory, Mathematical Logic,
and the Philosophy of Mathematics. Currently my interests in physics lie in the Philosophy of Physics
and Quantum Foundations. My interests in comptuer science lie at the intersection of all of these
and mostly center around the impact of Computability and Complexity Theory on these fields.
I like to read, discuss, and engage with ideas in these domains, so that's mostly what I'll be writing
about in my blog.
