I have a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the\nUniversity of Calgary.\nI am 24 years old and made this website to show off my projects, but mostly just to\ntalk about things that interest me on my blog.\nI wrote my undergraduate Honour’s thesis,\non the operational semantics of generalized theories of probability, with a focus on possibilistic theories.\nMy thesis was supervised by Dr. Carlo Maria Scandolo and Msc. Sam Steakly at the University of Calgary.\nAbout Me\nI began my university journey in physics, inspired by the numerous magical workings of the world around me.\nI (naively) believed that one day I would understand and formulate every way the world worked in precise\nmathematical equations. Those were simpler times, when clearly $F=ma$ ruled the world and before I understood\nthe importance of uncertainty.\nAs time went on I found myself annoyed at the constant labs and actual effort required to\ndo physics, and found that what I seemed to enjoy the most was building models and (more importantly) talking about\nmodels. This lead me down a more theoretical path into the world of computation, logic, and mathematics.\nI took a gap year after highschool and decided to make the most of it by teaching myself some math and also\na little python. It was here where I was first introduced to the Rust cult\nand my soul was damned. It was also when I discovered my passion for mathematics, which largely bled into\nhow I treated physics.\nThis passion for challenging myself led me to seek out competitions and I joined the university’s\nCompetitive Programming Club where I eventually became president.\nAfter a few years of messing around and unsuccesfully trying to get into computer science I came back to mathematics\nwhere I finished my degree. I don’t regret the strange and winding journey I took. I’ve made very many unique friends\nalong the way, many who I may not have known had I not started and traveled where I did.\nWhy do you like mathematics?\nMy interest in mathematics actually came from esports. I wanted to learn higher level math concepts to be able to\nrigorously prove (at the time calculate) how effective certain strategies where in the videogames that I played.\nUnfortunately I quickly discovered that basic calculus was not enough for this task and so began a long journey\nto touch various parts of mathematics.\nWhat are my main interests?\nCurrently my main interests in mathematics lie in Category Theory, Mathematical Logic,\nand the Philosophy of Mathematics. Currently my interests in physics lie in the Philosophy of Physics\nand Quantum Foundations. My interests in comptuer science lie at the intersection of all of these\nand mostly center around the impact of Computability and Complexity Theory on these fields.\nI like to read, discuss, and engage with ideas in these domains, so that’s mostly what I’ll be writing\nabout in my blog.\nBooks I am currently reading\nA non-exhaustive list of books I’m currently working through:\n\nFinance\n\nOption Pricing and Volatility Sheldon Natenburg\nTrading Volatility C. Bennet\n\n\nMath\n*\nPhilosophy\n\nCritique of Pure Reason Immanuel Kant\nTractatus Logico-pholisophicus L.
